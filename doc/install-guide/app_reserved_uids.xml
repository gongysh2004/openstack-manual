  <title>Reserved user IDs</title>

  <para>
    OpenStack reserves certain user IDs to run specific services and
    own specific files. These user IDs are set up according to the
    distribution packages. The following table gives an overview.
  </para>

  <note os="debian;opensuse;sles;ubuntu">
    <para>Some OpenStack packages generate and assign user IDs
      automatically during package installation. In these cases, the
      user ID value is not important. The existence of the user ID is
      what matters.
