        </listitem>
        <listitem>
            <para>Identity Service user with sudo privileges. Because
                Apache does not serve content from a root user, users

                with sudo privileges.</para>
        </listitem>

            <para>Python 2.7.
                The Python version must support
                Django. The Python version should run on any
                system, including Mac OS X. Installation prerequisites
                might differ by platform.</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Then, install and configure the dashboard on a node that
        can contact the Identity Service.</para>

                access the dashboard</para>
        </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>Your web browser, and that of your users,
         must support HTML5 and have cookies and
        JavaScript enabled.</para>
    <note>
        <para>To use the VNC client with the dashboard, the browser
            must support HTML5 Canvas and HTML5 WebSockets.</para>
